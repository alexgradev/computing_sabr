Computing (SBWL Business Mathematics)

In this repo I will store the final project me and my team worked on. This report implements and analyzes the SABR (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho) model for option pricing with stochastic volatility, as introduced by Hagan, Kumar, Lesniewski, and Woodward [2002]. We use numerical simulation methods following Glasserman [2004] and stochastic calculus theory from Shreve [2004].
